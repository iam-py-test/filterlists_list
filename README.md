# Filterlists list
A list of public filterlists, sorted by purpose.<br>


## How does it work?
This is a list of adblocker filterlists from around the internet. Filterlists of any purpose, size, format, and maintenance status should be included

## Types of filterlists
- Multi-purpose

Filterlists with many purposes (i.e. blocking trackers, ads, malware, **and** annoyances).
- Malware/phishing/scam protection

Filterlists for blocking malware, phishing, scams, and PUPs.
- Tracking parameter

Filterlists which remove unneeded or tracking parameters from websites
- Tracking protection

Filters designed to improve privacy
- Annoyances

Filters designed to block "annoyances" of any kind. This is a broad definition, and filterlists which do not explicitly have this purpose will be sorted somewhere else.
- Ads

Filterlists designed to block ads on any website (or one specific website). **This does not include lists for one specific region!**
- Regional

Filterlists designed to block ads, trackers, annoyances, and/or malware for one specific region only.
- Specific or unknown purpose

Filterlists with a very specific purpose but which are not specific to one region. This also includes filterlists with no known purpose.
- Malware

Not to be confused with "Malware/phishing/scam protection". This section lists filterlists which:
  - Preform actions which decrease the user's privacy and security without their knowledge or consent (i.e. secretly allowlisting random trackers)
  - Exist only to promote a specific website
  - Seek to exploit vulnerabilities in adblockers
  
Users are **strongly** advised to avoid these lists.

### Legal
Noting a filterlist here is not endorsement. All lists are under their own licenses.

### NOTE:
This is very much a work in progress!<br>
